You can use the developer console in your browser to get colours, pixel sizes and fonts etc from the real site.


## Notes

* Think about the flow of the page. Avoid absolute positioning unless it is completely necessary.
* Keep your CSS as simple as possible. There are very few parts of the page that should require more than three or four lines of CSS.
* Keep your HTML simple. Think about how you could split the page in to blocks.
